This file is for a hub insert for Baco typewriter ribbon 330 yard bulk reels, enabling the reel to be mounted on a fixture (not included) for easy rotation. A 6mm hole in the middle of the hub insert enables easy insertion of a bolt.
You will need to print two of these parts, each one mounts on either side of the reel opening.
